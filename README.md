#Gravity (for a lack of a better name)

Gravity is really just a simulation of the Solar System written in
CoffeeScript for canvas in modern browsers.

Since it relies on requestAnimationFrame it will not work in anything
else than Mozilla Firefox >=4.0, Google Chrome >=10.0 and Microsoft
Internet Explorer >=10.0.

It is heavily inspired from http://www.arachnoid.com/ruby/gravity/index.html -
which is also where I have the planetary data from.

If you want to run it, just clone this repo, run `bundle install` in the
dir, run the server with `rackup` and point your browser to
http://localhost:9292/
